Repository for 10 Days of ML, a TFUG Mumbai initiative. All the code would be pushed to the repo everyday at around 7 PM IST. The btter part would be all the codes would have explanations, which means if you are stuck on any part I do not expect you to copy/ paste but to understand the conncepts properly.
